## Project Purpose

The main objective of the Gif Finder App is to create a user-friendly GIF search tool. By allowing users to input their desired categories, the app fetches and presents GIFs related to the specified category. This project serves as a valuable learning experience for me as I explore application development with React and delve into unit testing using Jest and React Testing Library.
